      <h1> Results of Artistic Mini-Projects </h1>

      <p>
        We are pleased to announce the selected recipients for our open-call commissioning three innovative 
        artistic mini-projects!
        These projects aim to explore and address the bias inherent in mainstream AI models by creating music in genres
        often overlooked or marginalised by such systems.

        Congratulations to our winners, and thanks to all that applied. We received an overwhelming number of responses
        of high quality.

        We look forward to seeing how the awardees' work addresses the themes of Responsible AI (RAI) using low-resource models
        and small datasets.

       <h3> Project Description </h3> 
       <p> 

        “Erasure” is a sound installation that explores the complex relationship between voice, gender identity, and AI technology. It focuses on creating a speculative musical composition using vocal datasets from underrepresented queer and trans voices to address the bias embedded in mainstream voice-generative AI models. 
        The artistic idea behind the project is to create artistic work that amplifies silenced voices and genres while exploring the limitations and biases that currently restrict diversity in AI-generated music and voices.  

        Our voice plays a crucial role in both physical and symbolic aspects of identity and political representation. 
        For the queer and trans community, the voice is an important vehicle of self-expression but also a source of marginalisation. 
        AI technologies can particularly amplify gender-specific, racist, classist, and other biases. 
        Unique vocal expressions are generally overlooked or misinterpreted by AI models often programmed with voices shaped by cultural assumptions about "masculinity" and "femininity" leaving aside the complexity and richness of queer and trans voices. 
        Without the contributions of queer, non-binary, and trans people, AI systems will not be able to do justice to the full spectrum of human experiences but will instead perpetuate social exclusion mechanisms in the long term.

        <p> 
          Junson Park is a Korean artist who explores the boundaries between experimental electronic music and digital media art, focusing on the organic connections between various forms of expression. 
          He majored in Electronic Production and Design at Berklee College of Music and is now studying for an MFA in Music Technology at CalArts. 
          Based on his experimental music production background, he creates audiovisuals characterized by avant-garde soundscapes and cutting-edge technology to incorporate dynamic and interactive features of digital art elements into his performances and create fully immersive experiences for his audience. 
        </p>

    

      <h3> Project Description </h3>  
      <p> 
        This project seeks to overcome the limitations often seen in mainstream AI audio models by creating a custom approach to representing misrepresented cultural nuances, specifically within traditional Korean music. 
        By developing an impression-based sound arrangement that combines traditional Korean sound timbres with experimental, modern electronic influences, this project aims to create an auditory experience that resonates with authenticity and innovation. 
        This project is not merely focused on rhythm but explores Korean music's unique textures and timbres, including its distinctive odd-numbered meters.

        <p>
        Jugalbandi: Call and Response Between Tabla Player and Drum Player 
        </p>

        <p>
          My approach involves developing a rule-based method to deconstruct complex rhythmic structures into components that a computer can understand. 
          Once the rhythmic structure and feel are analyzed, the groove can ideally be played by any percussive instrument. 
          The intent is to make AI models more inclusive and culturally aware. 
          The project could also influence future developments in AI-driven composition tools, offering greater flexibility for artists working outside the Western musical realm.

      <h1>Call for Artistic Mini-Projects</h1>
      <p>We are commissioning 3 speculative artistic mini-projects to use AI to create music with genres that are
        currently marginalised by main-stream AI models. The aim of these mini-projects is to create impact and interest
        in Responsible AI (RAI) concerns of bias in AI models. These mini-projects will use AI tools such as
        low-resource AI models with small datasets and will be supported by the project team or industry partners where
        needed. The mini-projects will showcase the challenges of bias in AI and how RAI techniques can be used to
        address them.</p>
      <p>More information including a detailed list of requirements and a link to the application form can be found on
        <a href="/call">this page</a>.</p>

        <h1>About the MusicRAI Research Project</h1>
      </a>

      <p>This 12 month project <strong>"Responsible AI international community to reduce bias in AI music generation and
          analysis"</strong> will build an international community to address Responsible AI (RAI) challenges of bias in
        AI music generation and analysis.</p>
      <p>The aim of the project is to explore ways to tackle current over-reliance on huge training datasets for deep
        learning leads to AI models biased towards Western classical and pop music and marginalises other music genres.
        We will bring together an international and interdisciplinary team of researchers, musicians, and industry
        experts to make available AI tools, expertise, and datasets which improve access to marginalised music genres.
        This will directly benefit musicians and audiences engaging with a wider range of musical genres and benefits
        creative industries by offering new forms of music consumption.</p>

      <h1>Ethical and Responsible AI Music Making Workshop 2024</h1>

      <p>We held a one-day workshop on Responsible Music AI with a focus on bias in AI music generation systems on 17th
        July 2024 at the Creative Computing Institute, University of the Arts London, Holborn, London. </p>

      <p>We brought together over 100 people to form an interdisciplinary community of musicians, academics, and
        stakeholders to collaboratively identify the potential and challenges for using low-resource models and small
        datasets in musical practice. The workshop consisted of publicly streamed discussion panels, presentations of
        participants’ work, and brainstorming sessions on the future of AI and marginalised music. The event was
        followed by an evening reception featuring live performances using AI and small datasets of music. </p>

      <p>In the morning sessions we focussed on sharing and identifying current practices and challenges for AI music
        making with small datasets. The afternoon was dedicated to exploring opportunities and practical solutions to
        using small and marginalised datasets of music and other audio with AI. This forms the start of an international
        network and roadmap for a new ecosystem that we will build to rapidly open small music datasets and low-resource
        AI approaches to more wider use in music making and analysis. </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To bring together and grow the international community of researchers, creative practitioners, and AI
            experts interested in using musical genres marginalised by current AI systems (AI marginalisation) as
            datasets for AI music making practice and research.</li>
          <li>To establish an open repository of marginalised musical genre datasets for use in AI.</li>
          <li>To bring together and make available methods and tools for how artists might use techniques such as
            low-resource deep learning models to generate music using marginalized music genres.</li>
          <li>To commission a small number of speculative artistic projects resulting in international showcase of
            generative AI music using marginalised musical genres.</li>
          <li>To explore the translational potential of the AI techniques identified in this project to other creative
            practices.</li>
        </ul>
