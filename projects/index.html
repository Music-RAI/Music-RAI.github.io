<a id="projectinfo"><h1>Responsible AI Music Artistic Mini-Projects</h1></a>

<p>The aim of these mini-projects is to create impact and interest
	in Responsible AI (RAI) concerns of bias in AI models. These mini-projects use AI tools such as
	low-resource AI models with small datasets to showcase the challenges of bias in AI and how RAI techniques can be used to
	address them.</p>

						<p>These mini-projcts are part of a 12 month project <strong>"Responsible AI international community to reduce bias in AI music generation and analysis"</strong> which built an international community to address Responsible AI (RAI) challenges of bias in AI music generation and analysis. For more information about the project please see the project webpage: <a href = "http://musicrai.org">musicrai.org</a></p>

						<h1>Fá Maria: Erasure</h1>

						   <h3> Project Description </h3> 
						   <p> 
					
							“Erasure” is a sound installation that explores the complex relationship between voice, gender identity, and AI technology. It focuses on creating a speculative musical composition using vocal datasets from underrepresented queer and trans voices to address the bias embedded in mainstream voice-generative AI models. 
							The artistic idea behind the project is to create artistic work that amplifies silenced voices and genres while exploring the limitations and biases that currently restrict diversity in AI-generated music and voices.  
					
							Our voice plays a crucial role in both physical and symbolic aspects of identity and political representation. 
							For the queer and trans community, the voice is an important vehicle of self-expression but also a source of marginalisation. 
							AI technologies can particularly amplify gender-specific, racist, classist, and other biases. 
							Unique vocal expressions are generally overlooked or misinterpreted by AI models often programmed with voices shaped by cultural assumptions about "masculinity" and "femininity" leaving aside the complexity and richness of queer and trans voices. 
							Without the contributions of queer, non-binary, and trans people, AI systems will not be able to do justice to the full spectrum of human experiences but will instead perpetuate social exclusion mechanisms in the long term.

						  <h1>Junson Park: Utmori</h1>

						  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1056371125" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

						  <h3> Project Description </h3>  
						  <p> 
							This project seeks to overcome the limitations often seen in mainstream AI audio models by creating a custom approach to representing misrepresented cultural nuances, specifically within traditional Korean music. 
							By developing an impression-based sound arrangement that combines traditional Korean sound timbres with experimental, modern electronic influences, this project aims to create an auditory experience that resonates with authenticity and innovation. 
							This project is not merely focused on rhythm but explores Korean music's unique textures and timbres, including its distinctive odd-numbered meters.

							<p> 
							  Junson Park is a Korean artist who explores the boundaries between experimental electronic music and digital media art, focusing on the organic connections between various forms of expression. 
							  He majored in Electronic Production and Design at Berklee College of Music and is now studying for an MFA in Music Technology at CalArts. 
							  Based on his experimental music production background, he creates audiovisuals characterized by avant-garde soundscapes and cutting-edge technology to incorporate dynamic and interactive features of digital art elements into his performances and create fully immersive experiences for his audience.

						  <h1> Shreya Gupta: Jugalbandi</h1>
						  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1056422113" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

							<h3> Project Description </h3>
							
							<p>
							Jugalbandi: Call and Response Between Tabla Player and Drum Player 
							</p>
					
							<p>
							  My approach involves developing a rule-based method to deconstruct complex rhythmic structures into components that a computer can understand. 
							  Once the rhythmic structure and feel are analyzed, the groove can ideally be played by any percussive instrument. 
							  The intent is to make AI models more inclusive and culturally aware. 
							  The project could also influence future developments in AI-driven composition tools, offering greater flexibility for artists working outside the Western musical realm.
